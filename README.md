TITLE: Using Metasploit to bypass a NextGenAV product and implant and execute a Ransomware

Methods and Tools are described in the video:
keyword: .hta, Metasploit, Task Scheduler, Annabelle Ransomware, Next Gen AV

My previous videos were taken down unethically with closed minded to prevent us cyber security researchers and pen-testers alike from making a Realization to improve. They should have accepted it with open heart to improve and prove to us and to the existing and future clients that you do care and will do something to improve instead of blindly taking down videos without studying the methods used in the videos. Whether my agent version is outdated or not, prove to us that the updated version has fixed this issue and the method used no longer works. All agents were up-to-date during the video recording.

Don't get me wrong, their product is sexy and I love how their behavioral detection technology works especially with their Rollback feature. However, the concept is simple to bypass and of course, to simply not making it able to rollback is to stay under the radar. If it cannot detect, it will not be able to Rollback or it is too late to Rollback if the infection has gone too far too complicated that disconnects the dot from the first attack to the final effects. 

There are two blindspots shown in this video:
1) Download and Run from within MS Edge - malicious HTA
2) Annabelle Ransomware (Altered Hash) - Ransomware that does not rely on Command and Control server

Anyway, this attack only works purely in "Targetted Attack". Without the product to test, this attack will not be possible. However, any other attack methods that adopts similar strategy might work.

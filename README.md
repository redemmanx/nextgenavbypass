Methods and Tools are described in the video:
keyword: .hta, Metasploit, Task Scheduler, Annabelle Ransomware, Next Gen AV

My previous videos were taken down unethically with closed minded to prevent us cyber security researchers and pen-testers alike from making a Realization to improve. They should have accepted it with open heart to improve and prove to me and to new and upcoming customers that you care and will do something to improve instead of blindly taking down videos without studying the methods used in the videos. Whether my version is outdated or not, prove to us that the updated version has fixed this issue and the method used no longer works.
